# Barry - The simple UI Framework
Barry is a straight forward friction free UI Framework to make building interfaces as simple as possible.

## Layers
Barry comes with a few different layers sat on top of the markup. Each layer has a purpose but like building blocks they need to stack one on top of another.

1) Foundation
The base layer sets a little groundwork for Barry. It's where standard defaults are set on the `body` to get you off to a great start.

2) Structure
This is where Barry really starts working it's magic. This layer sets the base structure of all the Barry components. It's the layer that make the fields have consistent sizing for example.

3) Theme
This is where you define how Barry looks. We package up the default Barry theme but if you want to get stuck in and really make Barry your own this is where you want to start.

4) Function
Without the function layer Barry is pretty dumb. This layer is designed to add a little functionality to the components in the Barry framework. If you'd prefer to wrap your own JS around Barry that's fine too, this layer is optional.

## Work In Progress
The Barry framework is still very much in production and it's ready for any real-world uses. Once it's done though you can include it in your project with a few lines of code, contribute and build themes on top of Barry.
