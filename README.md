# Project Barry
Barry is a straight forward friction free UI Framework to make building interfaces as simple as possible. It comes in a few flavours depending on how you want to get setup.

### **Drop In**
This is as simple as downloading our zip package, extracting it and then putting a few file references in your project.


## Work In Progress
The Barry framework is still very much in production and it's not really ready for any real-world uses.
